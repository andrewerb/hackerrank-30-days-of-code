# HackerRank 30 Days of Code

Solutions to [HackerRank's 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) challenges.

*30 Days of Code* really is a nice small set of practice coding exercises, which I highly recommend for new or experienced devs looking to brush up.

This current runthrough (after much procrastination) is in **Python**. With many other languages supported by HackerRank, I may add subsequent attempts for practice/refreshers, or for learning languages I'm less familiar with.
